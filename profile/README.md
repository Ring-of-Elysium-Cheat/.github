## Comparisons with Other Cheats

Compared to games like **PUBG** or **Warzone**, **Ring of Elysium cheats** are often less crowded with detection systems, which makes them smoother to run. PUBG hacks are riskier due to stronger anti-cheat, while ROE sits in a sweet spot where features like ESP and aimbot run cleaner with fewer bans.

* **OS:** Windows 10 / 11
* **CPU:** Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better
* **RAM:** 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
* **GPU:** GTX 960 / RX 570 or higher
